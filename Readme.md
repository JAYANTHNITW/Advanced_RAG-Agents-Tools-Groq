# Chatbot with Llama2

## My Learnings:
1. ```from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser```

* ```parser = StrOutputParser()``` : Used to extract the relevant information from the raw output of the foundational model to human readable format and provides plain text (string)
***

2. **Envinormental Varibles**:
* In essence, the environment variable provides the API key value, but the code actively checks for its existence and uses it if available.
***
3. ```python-dotenv()```: Used to load the sensitive information present in ```.env()``` file to the current file.
* In summary, **python-dotenv** is a valuable tool for managing environment variables in Python projects, providing a secure and convenient way to store and access sensitive configuration details from a .env file.
