Using GPT-3 175B as an example ‚Äì deploying indepen-\\ndent instances of Ô¨Åne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively\\nexpensive. We propose Low-RankAdaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-\\ntrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each\\nlayer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa-\\nrameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B Ô¨Åne-tuned with Adam,\\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\\nGPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than Ô¨Åne-\\ntuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav-\\ning fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters,\\nno additional inference latency . We also provide an empirical investigation into\\nrank-deÔ¨Åciency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efÔ¨Åcacy of\\nLoRA.

More importantly, these method often fail to\\nmatch the Ô¨Åne-tuning baselines, posing a trade-off between efÔ¨Åciency and model quality.\\nWe take inspiration from Li et al. (2018a); Aghajanyan et al. (2020) which show that the learned\\nover-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the\\nchange in weights during model adaptation also has a low ‚Äúintrinsic rank‚Äù, leading to our proposed\\nLow-RankAdaptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural\\nnetwork indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers‚Äô change during\\nadaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure 1. Using GPT-3\\n175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e., rin Figure 1 can be one or two) sufÔ¨Åces even\\nwhen the full rank (i.e., d) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage- and compute-efÔ¨Åcient.\\nLoRA possesses several key advantages.\\n‚Ä¢ A pre-trained model can be shared and used to build many small LoRA modules for dif-\\nferent tasks. We can freeze the shared model and efÔ¨Åciently switch tasks by replacing the\\nmatricesAandBin Figure 1, reducing the storage requirement and task-switching over-\\nhead signiÔ¨Åcantly.\\n‚Ä¢ LoRA makes training more efÔ¨Åcient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3\\ntimes when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or\\nmaintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected,\\nmuch smaller low-rank matrices.\\n‚Ä¢ Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights\\nwhen deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully Ô¨Åne-tuned model, by\\nconstruction.\\n‚Ä¢ LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such\\nas preÔ¨Åx-tuning.

Consider adapting this\\npre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine\\nreading comprehension (MRC), and natural language to SQL (NL2SQL).

Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens\\nof works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-efÔ¨Åcient. See Sec-\\ntion 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there\\nare two prominent strategies when it comes to efÔ¨Åcient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby\\net al., 2019; RebufÔ¨Å et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; R ¬®uckl¬¥e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms\\nof the input layer activations (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;\\nLiu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and\\nlatency-sensitive production scenario.\\nAdapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency There are many variants of adapters. We focus\\non the original design by Houlsby et al. (2019) which has two adapter layers per Transformer block\\nand a more recent one by Lin et al. (2020) which has only one per block but with an additional\\nLayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016). While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploit-\\ning multi-task settings (R ¬®uckl¬¥e et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass\\nthe extra compute in adapter layers. This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed\\nto have few parameters (sometimes <1% of the original model) by having a small bottleneck di-\\nmension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware\\nparallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes\\na difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a\\ngeneric scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 (Radford et al., b)\\nmedium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a\\nvery small bottleneck dimension (Table 1).\\nThis problem gets worse when we need to shard the model as done in Shoeybi et al. (2020); Lep-\\nikhin et al. (2020), because the additional depth requires more synchronous GPU operations such as\\nAllReduce andBroadcast , unless we store the adapter parameters redundantly many times.\\nDirectly Optimizing the Prompt is Hard The other direction, as exempliÔ¨Åed by preÔ¨Åx tuning (Li\\n& Liang, 2021), faces a different challenge. We observe that preÔ¨Åx tuning is difÔ¨Åcult to optimize\\nand that its performance changes non-monotonically in trainable parameters, conÔ¨Årming similar\\nobservations in the original paper. More fundamentally, reserving a part of the sequence length for\\nadaptation necessarily reduces the sequence length available to process a downstream task, which\\nwe suspect makes tuning the prompt less performant compared to other methods. We defer the study\\non task performance to Section 5.\\n3', metadata={'source': 'LoRA- Low Rank Adaption LLMs.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The principles outlined here apply\\nto any dense layers in deep learning models, though we only focus on certain weights in Transformer\\nlanguage models in our experiments as the motivating use case.\\n4.1 L OW-RANK -PARAMETRIZED UPDATE MATRICES\\nA neural network contains many dense layers which perform matrix multiplication. The weight\\nmatrices in these layers typically have full-rank. When adapting to a speciÔ¨Åc task, Aghajanyan et al.\\n(2020) shows that the pre-trained language models have a low ‚Äúinstrisic dimension‚Äù and can still\\nlearn efÔ¨Åciently despite a random projection to a smaller subspace. Inspired by this, we hypothe-\\nsize the updates to the weights also have a low ‚Äúintrinsic rank‚Äù during adaptation. For a pre-trained\\nweight matrix W0‚ààRd√ók, we constrain its update by representing the latter with a low-rank de-\\ncomposition W0+ ‚àÜW=W0+BA, whereB‚ààRd√ór,A‚ààRr√ók, and the rank r‚â™min(d,k).\\nDuring training, W0is frozen and does not receive gradient updates, while AandBcontain trainable\\nparameters. Note both W0and‚àÜW=BAare multiplied with the same input, and their respective\\noutput vectors are summed coordinate-wise. For h=W0x, our modiÔ¨Åed forward pass yields:\\nh=W0x+ ‚àÜWx=W0x+BAx (3)\\nWe illustrate our reparametrization in Figure 1. We use a random Gaussian initialization for Aand\\nzero forB, so‚àÜW=BAis zero at the beginning of training. We then scale ‚àÜWx byŒ±\\nr, whereŒ±\\nis a constant in r. When optimizing with Adam, tuning Œ±is roughly the same as tuning the learning\\nrate if we scale the initialization appropriately. As a result, we simply set Œ±to the Ô¨Årstrwe try\\nand do not tune it. This scaling helps to reduce the need to retune hyperparameters when we vary\\nr(Yang & Hu, 2021).\\nA Generalization of Full Fine-tuning. A more general form of Ô¨Åne-tuning allows the training of\\na subset of the pre-trained parameters. LoRA takes a step further and does not require the accumu-\\nlated gradient update to weight matrices to have full-rank during adaptation. This means that when\\napplying LoRA to all weight matrices and training all biases2, we roughly recover the expressive-\\nness of full Ô¨Åne-tuning by setting the LoRA rank rto the rank of the pre-trained weight matrices. In\\nother words, as we increase the number of trainable parameters3, training LoRA roughly converges\\nto training the original model, while adapter-based methods converges to an MLP and preÔ¨Åx-based\\nmethods to a model that cannot take long input sequences.\\nNo Additional Inference Latency. When deployed in production, we can explicitly compute and\\nstoreW=W0+BA and perform inference as usual. Note that both W0andBA are inRd√ók.\\nWhen we need to switch to another downstream task, we can recover W0by subtracting BAand\\nthen adding a different B‚Ä≤A‚Ä≤, a quick operation with very little memory overhead.

       " Document(page_content='guarantees that we do not introduce any additional latency during inference compared to a Ô¨Åne-tuned\\nmodel by construction.\\n4.2 A PPLYING LORA TOTRANSFORMER\\nIn principle, we can apply LoRA to any subset of weight matrices in a neural network to reduce the\\nnumber of trainable parameters. In the Transformer architecture, there are four weight matrices in\\nthe self-attention module ( Wq,Wk,Wv,Wo) and two in the MLP module. We treat Wq(orWk,Wv)\\nas a single matrix of dimension dmodel√ódmodel , even though the output dimension is usually sliced\\ninto attention heads. We limit our study to only adapting the attention weights for downstream\\ntasks and freeze the MLP modules (so they are not trained in downstream tasks) both for simplicity\\nand parameter-efÔ¨Åciency.We further study the effect on adapting different types of attention weight\\nmatrices in a Transformer in Section 7.1. We leave the empirical investigation of adapting the MLP\\nlayers, LayerNorm layers, and biases to a future work.\\nPractical BeneÔ¨Åts and Limitations. The most signiÔ¨Åcant beneÔ¨Åt comes from the reduction in\\nmemory and storage usage. For a large Transformer trained with Adam, we reduce that VRAM\\nusage by up to 2/3ifr‚â™dmodel as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the frozen\\nparameters. On GPT-3 175B, we reduce the VRAM consumption during training from 1.2TB to\\n350GB. With r= 4and only the query and value projection matrices being adapted, the checkpoint\\nsize is reduced by roughly 10,000 √ó(from 350GB to 35MB)4. This allows us to train with signiÔ¨Å-\\ncantly fewer GPUs and avoid I/O bottlenecks. Another beneÔ¨Åt is that we can switch between tasks\\nwhile deployed at a much lower cost by only swapping the LoRA weights as opposed to all the\\nparameters. This allows for the creation of many customized models that can be swapped in and out\\non the Ô¨Çy on machines that store the pre-trained weights in VRAM. We also observe a 25% speedup\\nduring training on GPT-3 175B compared to full Ô¨Åne-tuning5as we do not need to calculate the\\ngradient for the vast majority of the parameters.\\nLoRA also has its limitations. For example, it is not straightforward to batch inputs to different tasks\\nwith different AandBin a single forward pass, if one chooses to absorb AandBintoWto eliminate\\nadditional inference latency. Though it is possible to not merge the weights and dynamically choose\\nthe LoRA modules to use for samples in a batch for scenarios where latency is not critical.\\n5 E MPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS\\nWe evaluate the downstream task performance of LoRA on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), De-\\nBERTa (He et al., 2021), and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b), before scaling up to GPT-3 175B (Brown\\net al., 2020). Our experiments cover a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding\\n(NLU) to generation (NLG). SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we evaluate on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) benchmark\\nfor RoBERTa and DeBERTa. We follow the setup of Li & Liang (2021) on GPT-2 for a direct com-\\nparison and add WikiSQL (Zhong et al., 2017) (NL to SQL queries) and SAMSum (Gliwa et al.,\\n2019) (conversation summarization) for large-scale experiments on GPT-3. See Appendix C for\\nmore details on the datasets we use. We use NVIDIA Tesla V100 for all experiments.\\n5.1 B ASELINES\\nTo compare with other baselines broadly, we replicate the setups used by prior work and reuse their\\nreported numbers whenever possible. This, however, means that some baselines might only appear\\nin certain experiments.\\nFine-Tuning (FT) is a common approach for adaptation.

While RoBERTa has been overtaken by much larger models on NLP leaderboards\\nsuch as the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019) in recent years, it remains a competitive and\\npopular pre-trained model for its size among practitioners. We take the pre-trained RoBERTa base\\n(125M) and RoBERTa large (355M) from the HuggingFace Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2020)\\nand evaluate the performance of different efÔ¨Åcient adaptation approaches on tasks from the GLUE\\nbenchmark. We also replicate Houlsby et al. (2019) and Pfeiffer et al. (2021) according to their\\nsetup. To ensure a fair comparison, we make two crucial changes to how we evaluate LoRA when\\ncomparing with adapters. First, we use the same batch size for all tasks and use a sequence length\\nof 128 to match the adapter baselines. Second, we initialize the model to the pre-trained model for\\nMRPC, RTE, and STS-B, not a model already adapted to MNLI like the Ô¨Åne-tuning baseline.

Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is a sequence-to-sequence\\narchitecture that makes heavy use of self-attention. Radford et al. (a) applied it to autoregressive lan-\\nguage modeling by using a stack of Transformer decoders. Since then, Transformer-based language\\nmodels have dominated NLP, achieving the state-of-the-art in many tasks. A new paradigm emerged\\nwith BERT (Devlin et al., 2019b) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) ‚Äì both are large Transformer lan-\\n8', metadata={'source': 'LoRA- Low Rank Adaption LLMs.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

Training larger Transformers generally results in better performance and\\nremains an active research direction. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the largest single Transformer\\nlanguage model trained to-date with 175B parameters.\\nPrompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning. While GPT-3 175B can adapt its behavior with just a\\nfew additional training examples, the result depends heavily on the input prompt (Brown et al.,\\n2020). This necessitates an empirical art of composing and formatting the prompt to maximize a\\nmodel‚Äôs performance on a desired task, which is known as prompt engineering or prompt hacking.\\nFine-tuning retrains a model pre-trained on general domains to a speciÔ¨Åc task Devlin et al. (2019b);\\nRadford et al. (a). Variants of it include learning just a subset of the parameters Devlin et al. (2019b);\\nCollobert & Weston (2008), yet practitioners often retrain all of them to maximize the downstream\\nperformance. However, the enormity of GPT-3 175B makes it challenging to perform Ô¨Åne-tuning in\\nthe usual way due to the large checkpoint it produces and the high hardware barrier to entry since it\\nhas the same memory footprint as pre-training.\\nParameter-EfÔ¨Åcient Adaptation. Many have proposed inserting adapter layers between existing\\nlayers in a neural network (Houlsby et al., 2019; RebufÔ¨Å et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2020). Our method\\nuses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The\\nkey functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during\\ninference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3).\\nA comtenporary extension of adapter is COMPACTER (Mahabadi et al., 2021), which essentially\\nparametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing\\nscheme. Similarly, combining LoRA with other tensor product-based methods could potentially\\nimprove its parameter efÔ¨Åciency, which we leave to future work. More recently, many proposed\\noptimizing the input word embeddings in lieu of Ô¨Åne-tuning, akin to a continuous and differentiable\\ngeneralization of prompt engineering (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al.,\\n2020; Liu et al., 2021). We include comparisons with Li & Liang (2021) in our experiment section.\\nHowever, this line of works can only scale up by using more special tokens in the prompt, which\\ntake up available sequence length for task tokens when positional embeddings are learned.\\nLow-Rank Structures in Deep Learning. Low-rank structure is very common in machine learn-\\ning. A lot of machine learning problems have certain intrinsic low-rank structure (Li et al., 2016;\\nCai et al., 2010; Li et al., 2018b; Grasedyck et al., 2013). Moreover, it is known that for many\\ndeep learning tasks, especially those with a heavily over-parametrized neural network, the learned\\nneural network will enjoy low-rank properties after training (Oymak et al., 2019). Some prior works\\neven explicitly impose the low-rank constraint when training the original neural network (Sainath\\net al., 2013; Povey et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2016; Kho-\\ndak et al., 2021; Denil et al., 2014); however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these works\\nconsiders low-rank update to a frozen model for adaptation to downstream tasks . In theory liter-\\nature, it is known that neural networks outperform other classical learning methods, including the\\ncorresponding (Ô¨Ånite-width) neural tangent kernels (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2018) when\\nthe underlying concept class has certain low-rank structure (Ghorbani et al., 2020; Allen-Zhu & Li,\\n2019; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2020a). Another theoretical result in Allen-Zhu & Li (2020b) suggests that\\nlow-rank adaptations can be useful for adversarial training. In sum, we believe that our proposed\\nlow-rank adaptation update is well-motivated by the literature.\\n7 U NDERSTANDING THE LOW-RANK UPDATES\\nGiven the empirical advantage of LoRA, we hope to further explain the properties of the low-rank\\nadaptation learned from downstream tasks. Note that the low-rank structure not only lowers the\\nhardware barrier to entry which allows us to run multiple experiments in parallel, but also gives\\nbetter interpretability of how the update weights are correlated with the pre-trained weights. We\\nfocus our study on GPT-3 175B, where we achieved the largest reduction of trainable parameters\\n(up to 10,000√ó) without adversely affecting task performances.\\nWe perform a sequence of empirical studies to answer the following questions: 1) Given a parameter\\nbudget constraint, which subset of weight matrices in a pre-trained Transformer should we adapt\\n9', metadata={'source': 'LoRA- Low Rank Adaption LLMs.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

This can shed light on the\\nunderlying mechanism for adapting pre-trained language models.\\nTo answer these questions, we project Wonto ther-dimensional subspace of ‚àÜWby comput-\\ningU‚ä§WV‚ä§, withU/Vbeing the left/right singular-vector matrix of ‚àÜW. Then, we com-\\npare the Frobenius norm between ‚à•U‚ä§WV‚ä§‚à•Fand‚à•W‚à•F.

The weight matrices are taken from\\nthe 48th layer of GPT-3.\\nWe draw several conclusions from Table 7. First, ‚àÜWhas a stronger correlation with Wcompared\\nto a random matrix, indicating that ‚àÜWampliÔ¨Åes some features that are already in W. Second,\\ninstead of repeating the top singular directions of W,‚àÜWonly ampliÔ¨Åes directions that are not\\nemphasized in W. Third, the ampliÔ¨Åcation factor is rather huge: 21.5‚âà6.91/0.32forr= 4.\\nSee Section H.4 for why r= 64 has a smaller ampliÔ¨Åcation factor. We also provide a visualization\\nin Section H.3 for how the correlation changes as we include more top singular directions from Wq.\\nThis suggests that the low-rank adaptation matrix potentially ampliÔ¨Åes the important features for\\nspeciÔ¨Åc downstream tasks that were learned but not emphasized in the general pre-training model .\\n8 C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\\nFine-tuning enormous language models is prohibitively expensive in terms of the hardware required\\nand the storage/switching cost for hosting independent instances for different tasks. We propose\\nLoRA, an efÔ¨Åcient adaptation strategy that neither introduces inference latency nor reduces input\\nsequence length while retaining high model quality. Importantly, it allows for quick task-switching\\nwhen deployed as a service by sharing the vast majority of the model parameters. While we focused\\non Transformer language models, the proposed principles are generally applicable to any neural\\nnetworks with dense layers.\\nThere are many directions for future works. 1) LoRA can be combined with other efÔ¨Åcient adapta-\\ntion methods, potentially providing orthogonal improvement. 2) The mechanism behind Ô¨Åne-tuning\\nor LoRA is far from clear ‚Äì how are features learned during pre-training transformed to do well\\non downstream tasks?

Consequently,\\nadapter layers must be computed in addition to the base model, inevitably introducing additional\\nlatency. While as pointed out in R ¬®uckl¬¥e et al. (2020), the latency introduced by adapter layers can\\nbe mitigated when the model batch size and/or sequence length is large enough to full utilize the\\nhardware parallelism. We conÔ¨Årm their observation with a similar latency study on GPT-2 medium\\nand point out that there are scenarios, notably online inference where the batch size is small, where\\nthe added latency can be signiÔ¨Åcant.\\nWe measure the latency of a single forward pass on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000 by averaging\\nover 100 trials. We vary the input batch size, sequence length, and the adapter bottleneck dimension\\nr. We test two adapter designs: the original one by Houlsby et al. (2019), which we call AdapterH,\\nand a recent, more efÔ¨Åcient variant by Lin et al. (2020), which we call AdapterL. See Section 5.1\\nfor more details on the designs.

In Table 16, we show the performance of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-\\nn. To our surprise, PreÔ¨ÅxEmbed and PreÔ¨ÅxLayer performs very poorly on MNLI-100 dataset, with\\nPreÔ¨ÅxEmbed performing only slightly better than random chance (37.6% vs. 33.3%).

The gap between preÔ¨Åx-based approaches and LoRA/Fine-tuning becomes smaller as we in-\\ncrease the number of training examples, which might suggest that preÔ¨Åx-based approaches are not\\nsuitable for low-data tasks in GPT-3.
