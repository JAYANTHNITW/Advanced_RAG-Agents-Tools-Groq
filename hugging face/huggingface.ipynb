Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens\\nof works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-efﬁcient. See Sec-\\ntion 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there\\nare two prominent strategies when it comes to efﬁcient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby\\net al., 2019; Rebufﬁ et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; R ¨uckl´e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms\\nof the input layer activations (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;', metadata={'source': 'researchpapers\\\\LoRA- Low Rank Adaption LLMs.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
